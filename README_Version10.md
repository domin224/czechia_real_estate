# czechia_real_estate

A data analysis project focused on the Czech real estate market. This repository is part of my data portfolio and demonstrates my skills in data acquisition, processing, and visualization.

## Project Overview

- **Data Scraping:** Automated collection of real estate data from publicly available sources.
- **Data Cleaning & Transformation:** The collected data is cleaned and pre-processed using SQL (e.g., removing duplicates, data formatting, etc.).
- **Data Storage:** Data is saved to a suitable database and prepared for further analysis.
- **Visualization:** The processed data is visualized in Power BI or Tableau, with final outputs available as interactive dashboards or static reports.

## Technologies Used

- **Python** – for data scraping and initial data manipulation
- **SQL** – for data cleaning and transformation
- **Power BI / Tableau** – for visualization and dashboard creation

## Project Outputs

- Interactive dashboards (.pbix for Power BI, Tableau Public)
- Static reports in PDF format

## How to Use the Project

1. **Data Scraping:**  
   Run the provided Python scripts to collect up-to-date real estate data from selected sources.

2. **Data Processing:**  
   Import the data into a SQL database and apply the required transformations using the included SQL scripts.

3. **Visualization:**  
   Load the processed data into Power BI or Tableau and use the prepared visualizations, or create your own dashboards. Alternatively, export the results as PDF reports or share .pbix files.

## Disclaimer

This dashboard presents average real estate prices and income data across the Czech Republic. Historical data comes from the ČÚZK database, which does not include 2024. Income data is from the ČSÚ. Data for 2025 was scraped from Sreality.cz on July 11 and reflects a snapshot, not a full-year average. The dashboard demonstrates the author’s skills in web scraping, data processing, and visualization; 2025 data is included to showcase technical abilities rather than provide a full market overview.
